## ⚠️ Academic Integrity Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT - READ BEFORE PROCEEDING:**

This repository contains my personal solutions to the Java MOOC course exercises. It is made public for the following purposes:
- 📂 **Portfolio showcase** - Demonstrating my learning journey and coding skills
- 📚 **Personal reference** - Serving as my own documentation and revision material
- 🤝 **Inspiration** - Helping others understand different approaches to problem-solving

### 🚫 What This Repository Is NOT:
- ❌ A source for copying solutions to submit as your own work
- ❌ A shortcut to bypass the learning process
- ❌ A substitute for doing the exercises yourself

### ✅ Ethical Use Guidelines:
If you're currently taking this course:
1. **Attempt exercises independently first** - Struggle is part of learning
2. **Use as a last resort** - Only after genuine attempts and research
3. **Understand, don't copy** - Read to understand concepts, then write your own code
4. **Respect the honor code** - The course relies on academic integrity

> **Quote from Helsinki MOOC:**
> *"We expect students to submit solutions that are the result of their own work. If you use this repository, make sure you're learning, not just copying."*

**Remember:** Employers value problem-solving skills, not copied code. The struggle is where the learning happens! 💪
